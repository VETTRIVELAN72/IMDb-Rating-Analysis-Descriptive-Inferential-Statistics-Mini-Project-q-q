 🎬 Mini Project: IMDb Rating Analysis

 Focus: Descriptive & Inferential Statistics
📌 Project Overview
This project explores the IMDb Top 250 Shows dataset to understand rating patterns using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from historical IMDb data before applying predictive models.

📊 Descriptive Statistics

Analyzed central tendency (mean, median, mode) of IMDb ratings.

Measured dispersion using variance and standard deviation.

Studied distribution shapes of ratings and votes.

Identified outliers and data consistency.

📈 Inferential Statistics

Examined relationships between votes and ratings using correlation.

Compared rating behavior across genres and time periods.

Used statistical evidence to validate observed trends.

Supported conclusions using data-driven reasoning rather than assumptions.

📉 Visual Analysis

🧰 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for preprocessing support)

✅ Key Takeaways

Statistical analysis provides strong intuition before model building.

IMDb ratings are influenced more by consistency of audience engagement than sheer popularity.

Combining descriptive and inferential statistics improves analytical confidence.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Hypothesis testing (ANOVA / t-tests)

Regression-based inference

Advanced feature importance analysis
