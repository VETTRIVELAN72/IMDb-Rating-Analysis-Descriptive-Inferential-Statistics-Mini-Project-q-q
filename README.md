🔹 IMDb-Rating-Analysis-Descriptive-Inferential-Statistics-Mini-Project 🎬📊

I recently completed a mini data analysis project using the IMDb Top 250 Shows dataset, where the focus was on applying Descriptive and Inferential Statistics to understand what drives IMDb ratings.

🔍What I worked on:

Performed descriptive analysis (mean, median, variance, distribution) to understand IMDb ratings and vote counts.

Analyzed rating distributions across years and genres.

Studied relationships between number of votes and ratings using correlation analysis.

Applied inferential statistics to identify statistically significant patterns and trends.

Visualized insights using histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps.

📈 Key Insights:

IMDb ratings show a tight distribution, indicating consistent audience scoring for top-rated shows.

Shows with higher vote counts generally maintain stable ratings, suggesting stronger audience consensus.

Certain genres consistently outperform others in average ratings.

Statistical relationships helped validate patterns beyond visual intuition.

🛠 Tools Used:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn

This project strengthened my foundation in EDA, statistical thinking, and data storytelling, which are essential skills for real-world data science problems.
